# TV Game Show board game in Python Curses
...yeah

## Wat
I'm working on a board game and decided to prototype it in curses rather than cardboard, or anything reasonable to be honest.

## Run
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py
```
For now you can roll the dice by either clicking on the "Roll!" or pressing `r`.  
`q` to quit.
